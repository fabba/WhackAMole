TODO
==========

- Create more rounds and especially levels (and play test them quite a few times).
- Get time of current game, and not system time! (When pausing a game this can cause serious issues).
- Fix background bug when switching from game to menu and back again.
- Actualy make login work.
- Save game states.
- Allow resume.
- Fix some overall visual effects (moles + parts of the background overlapping effects).
- Tons of Todo's in the code itself.
- Should probably rename LevelModel to GameModel and move some logic to RoundModel.
- (EXTRA) Select specific level + round?
